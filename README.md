# Phobos Group Information Security Water Line Theory

This document has been prepared in an effort to guide security efforts in the larger information security sphere. Our intention with authoring this document is to illustrate, with no ambiguity, the differences between the type of actors that behave in the "attacker" arena. 

Many folks who have been working blueteam will see this as immediately making sense, and may redteam folks may see this and attempt to place themselves on this graph. 

The intention of this graph is not to "grade anybody", as it is to just "be a legend" for the type of threats that we see in the landscape today. 

Ideally, this will help both attackers and defenders understand that we're all on the same side at the end of the day, and that the threats our customers face are ultimately what we are here to help with.
